# SpringHibernate
Spring, Hibernate, Bootstrap, Maven, JSP, MySql, RandomDataGenerator.

Example of spring, hibernate with random data generation.

Random data generator is added for generating random data, exporting. At the moment supported generating random
data is from ORM classes and predefined fields with output in JSON. GUI validation for fields in JSON random data
generation is not done yet. So there it is possible to have some errors if you don't create them correctly. There is
example for every type in sql script createDB.sql. If you create fields like that it will work.

GUI will be updated as soon as I have free time.
